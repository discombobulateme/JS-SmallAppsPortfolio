<h1> JS Small Apps Portfolio</h1>

Those are a few web applications created to study Javascript.
Structure is very simple: a HTML and a JS file with equal name per each app.
Follow a list with intended structure used to develop each app.

<h2>ToDo App</h2>

This app is used to create a browser to do list. 
Within this list is possible to add and delete an item. 
The global variable localStorage is used to save the list even when refreshing the browser.
